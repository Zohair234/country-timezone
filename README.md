# Countries and Timezones

There are 134+ countries with time zones.  I will update it frequently, until I add all the countries.

Please don't hesitate to ask for a change if you notice any wrong information. 


### How I collected all the information;

- Confirmed and checked all timezones here https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php
- Confirmed and checked all countries code here https://www.iban.com/country-codes 
- Confirmed and checked all phone codes here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes

### Validation

[JSON](https://github.com/osmanyz/countries-and-timezones/blob/main/countries-timezones.json) is validated and it passed all the validations. You can verify this yourself.

### Thank you!

Please don't forget to say thank you by giving a star :) It takes long time to collect and confirm all these data and make them one piece as a JSON which could be quite important for your projects need.
